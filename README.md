# 🏙️ SmartCity Sentinel  
### AI-Powered Smart City Monitoring & Alert System

SmartCity Sentinel is an intelligent, microservices-based platform designed to monitor, analyze, and alert on critical urban systems such as traffic, pollution, waste management, and public safety.  
It acts as a **digital guardian (sentinel)** for modern smart cities.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🚦 Real-time traffic density monitoring
- 🌫️ Air quality (AQI) monitoring and alerts
- 🗑️ Smart waste bin level tracking
- 🚨 Emergency & notification service
- 📡 Real-time updates using WebSockets
- 🧠 AI-ready architecture for future predictions

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows a **microservices architecture**, where each service is independently developed, deployed, and scaled.

**Core Components:**
- Service Discovery (Eureka Server)
- API Gateway
- Domain Microservices
- Centralized communication & monitoring

*(Architecture diagram can be added here)*
